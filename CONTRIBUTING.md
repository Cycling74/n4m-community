All contributions must follow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Cycling74/n4m-community/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and by contributing to this collection you are agreeing to abide by its rules. Any examples that do not follow the Code of Conduct are subject to removal.

## Adding a Node For Max Example

To add an example, you will need to add to the list in the [README](https://github.com/Cycling74/n4m-community/blob/master/README.md) by creating a pull request. 

### Style and Formatting Guidelines
- Each pull request should contain only one additional example.
- Search through the current examples to make sure you are not submitting a duplicate one.
- Though not necessary, ideally each example would link to a GitHub repository which contains documentation and code. 
- The format within the list is `[Name](link) by [Author](link) - Description`.
- Make sure the example is well documented! It should be clear how to use the example. 

### Updating your PR

Making a PR adhere to the standards above can sometimes be difficult. If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, you can just edit the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that, [here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/docs/blob/master/amending-a-commit-guide.md) on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.

## Updates to this Repository

You are also welcome to create an issue or pull request suggesting changes to how this collection works, removing dead links, removing an outdated example, and so on.
